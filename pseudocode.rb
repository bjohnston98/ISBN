Write code for a prompt, take in number as input.
Into Init_array, index at -1, do.loop evaluate each position as integer or other.
if other, remove that character, chrink/chop/reindex the array. 
	Need xtimes.do until out of variables. Write all the valid numeralcharacters into an 
	Gud_String_array, COUNT the integer-like variables remaining, if there are 
	10 or 13 = good. If not 10 or 13, give error msg, reloop, prompt for new input string.

index the array, mult position 0 *1, position 1*2, etc until position 9*10,
sum these, take modulo 11 as resulting check digit. (and if modulo11 = 10, 2 digits
	use 'X')

	gawd. if good number, give affirmative, if not request another number
	So a loop needed here.

	input_str = 
	loop
